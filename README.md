# Kovato Website

## Project Overview
Kovato is the future of web design and development, offering a subscription-based model for businesses to access high-quality, customized web and app solutions without the need for large upfront costs. This project involves building the Kovato website from scratch using Nuxt3 and TailwindCSS, following a brand guide to deliver a cohesive and professional online presence.

The Kovato website is essential to launching the business. It showcases a full integration of brand, design, and development, demonstrating my ability to build a fully functional platform. This includes CRUD operations, user authentication, database integration with row-level security (RLS), and features like sign-ins, bill payments, and account management. The website aims to be user-friendly, responsive, and secure.

## Technologies Used
- **Nuxt3**: A modern framework for building web applications with Vue.js, used to create the structure and logic for the website.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for responsive styling and ensuring a mobile-friendly user experience.
- **Supabase**: Used for backend services, including user authentication, database integration, and RLS to ensure data security.

## Project Goals
- **Custom Website Design**: Build a website that aligns with the Kovato brand guide, emphasizing custom design over templates or pre-built themes.
- **User Authentication and Payments**: Implement a user account system for managing personal details, signing up for plans, and making bill payments. Supabase is used for authentication, ensuring security throughout the process.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate with Supabase for data management, utilizing row-level security to protect user data. The implementation of RLS ensures each user only accesses their data.
- **Company Portfolio and Contact**: Create sections for the company portfolio and a contact form, maintaining consistency with the brand guide.
- **Performance and Optimization**: Ensure the site is fast, secure, and optimized for SEO to improve visibility.
