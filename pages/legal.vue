      <p class="mb-4">

        and domain solely for the duration of an active subscription. The
        initial term of the subscription is fixed at a minimum of 12 months.
        Upon the conclusion of the initial term, you may exercise one of the

          maintain the license.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Purchase the exclusive rights to the design and domain, including all
          associated intellectual property such as the brand guide, logo, and
          color palette, for a one-time consideration of
          <strong>$2,500 USD</strong>.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          Acquire the proprietary rights to the underlying source code, subject
          to the following fee structure:
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
            <li class="mb-1">
              For projects involving less than one month of development: The
              source code is included as part of the $2,500 USD fee for the
              design and domain.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-1">
              For each additional month of development: An incremental fee of
              $2,500 USD per development month will apply.
            </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        It is expressly understood and agreed that while the purchase of the
        design and domain transfers ownership of these assets to the subscriber,
        Kovato retains full legal and equitable ownership of the underlying
        source code. No rights, title, or interest in the code shall transfer to
        the subscriber except as explicitly provided herein. Any such transfer
        must be formalized through a separate, written agreement duly executed
        by Kovato.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta,
        Canada, and any disputes arising from or related to this agreement shall
        be adjudicated exclusively within the competent courts of Alberta.
